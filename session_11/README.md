# Session 11 outline

* ## Quiz 2 (oral recapitulation of previous topics)
* ## Mid-term project presentations

   * ### Each student has chosen a cutting-edge genomics paper. On November 14, 2024, they delivered a 10-15 minute presentation and led a classroom discussion on the topic. The objective was for students to gain insight into advanced methods that, while not directly applicable to their PhD work, are valuable for a comprehensive understanding of the field.
