# Session 6 outline

* ## Quiz 1 (oral recapitulation of previous topics)
* ## Paper presentations
# Each student has chosen an -omics paper that they find innovative, exciting, relevant to their work, or particularly interesting. On October 10, 2024, they delivered a 10-minute presentation that provided a concise overview of the research question addressed and a thorough explanation of the computational methods employed.
