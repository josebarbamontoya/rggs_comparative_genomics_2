## Course description
### This project-based course introduces computational tools for interpreting molecular sequencing data, focusing on genome and transcriptome assembly, comparative analyses (both de novo and reference-based), and phylogenomic inference. The course emphasizes documentation, reproducibility, and computational proficiency. Students will address experimental questions starting from raw data, relevant to their research, with the goal of laying a foundation for a publishable final product. They are encouraged to use their own data or select an appropriate dataset. For further details, refer to the [course syllabus](https://github.com/josebarbamontoya/rggs_comparative_genomics_2/blob/main/CG2_Syllabus_Fall_2024_20241014.pdf).
