# Session 15 outline

* ## GitHub tutorial due
* ## Final project presentations

   * ### The main goal of the final project was to develop well-formulated research questions that could be addressed using -omics data and appropriate computational methods, along with fully documented and reproducible computational pipelines. Students crafted a research question, selected suitable methods, and created a detailed GitHub tutorial outlining the necessary computational steps. The final project included a detailed tutorial, which was shared on each studentâ€™s GitHub account. Additionally, students delivered a 10-minute presentation on their final project.
